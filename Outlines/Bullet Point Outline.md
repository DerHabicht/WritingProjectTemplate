You can find the document from which this is derived from in [this collection](https://abbiee.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a761264f84ac176a17ff801a3&id=c245b54fd3).

The extra information from that document is present as a guide while outlining. I recommend "cleaning it up" as you by deleting the explanations and prompts once you've filled in that part of the outline.

# Act 1

## Hook: Introduction to Protagonist’s Inner Conflict

### Explanation
The hook is internal conflict, which is simple: desire vs fear. Despite popular
belief, the internal conflict starts long before the inciting incident shows up
to destroy your protagonist’s life. In fact, that conflict has been boiling
just below the surface this whole time — otherwise, your inciting incident
wouldn’t matter. See, external conflict (the plot) is all about what happens;
but internal conflict (the story) is about why it matters.

### PROMPT
- What does my protagonist think will bring her true happiness or contentment?
- How is her fear stopping her from going after it?
- What is my character’s misbelief and what happened in their past to create
this misbelief?
- How can I show my audience in the FIRST FIVE MINUTES why “what’s happening”
**matters** to my protagonist, given their desire, fear, and misbelief?

## Inciting Incident: Protagonist Is Pushed Outside Comfort Zone

### Explanation
This is the event that really sets your story in motion. Your inciting incident
doesn’t have to be some big, epic, crazy call-to-adventure. It just has to be
something that pushes your protagonist outside their comfort zone. A conflict
surfaces — something the protagonist has to face head-on. It’s really as simple
as that. Don’t overcomplicate it, as many writers do. If you know why the
inciting incident matters to the protagonist and you let them react to it as a
normal person would (running for cover because of their fear!) CONGRATULATIONS.
You nailed it.

### Prompt
- Why does this inciting incident matter to my protagonist? 
- How does the incidint incident push the MC outside her comfort zone?
- What internal conflict is going to arise for my protagonist in wake of the
inciting incident?

## BUILD-UP: The Impossible Question

### Explanation
Protagonist is going to have to face this thing head on. The reader can now see
what the protagonist’s internal struggle really is, and how this whole
situation is going to be especially tricky for her to navigate.

### PROMPT
- What is the “impossible choice”? Your protagonist must be faced with options:
stay inside their comfort zone and risk NEVER getting What They Desire, or
venture into the unknown and accomplish their goal while STILL avoiding their
fear.

## First Plot Point: Protagonist Makes a Decision which Determines What Happens Next

### Explanation
Your protagonist is a conflicted person—torn between desire and fear. So when
the inciting incident steps in and shoves them outside their comfort zone,
their fear takes over and they respond based on their misbelief, which sets up
more obstacles for the rest of the book. The human brain makes decisions by
avoiding the most pain—so what is the LEAST painful option, in the long run?
Venturing into the unknown and risking some danger… but ultimately getting what
you have always desired.

### PROMPT:
- How is my protagonist going to react to the inciting incident, given their fear and
misbelief about the world? 
- What decision are they going to make now to avoid the most pain? (And get
what they want while steering clear of the thing they’re afraid of?)

## First Pinch Point: Opposition/Antagonistic Force Looms in the Distance

### Explanation
You can have a pinch point even if you don’t have a “villain” character in your
story. It doesn’t have to be a villain — it doesn’t have to be a person. It just has to be
something that is ultimately going to come back to haunt the protagonist later. (It can
even be the protagonist’s misbelief.)

### Prompt
- What is the opposition/antagonistic force my protagonist is going to have to
face head-on later? 
- How can I show the reader that it’s already looming in the distance?

# Act 2

## Pre-Midpoint Reactionary Hero: Protagonist Pursues Their Fear-Based Goal

### Explanation
Thanks to the decision your protagonist made at the end of act one, they are
now a man (or a woman) with a plan. They have a goal now that they are actively
pursuing.  Essentially, they’re going after the thing they think will make them
happy while still steering clear of the thing they’re afraid of. Whether
they’re running away from something or running to something, their motivation
is the same: avoid as much pain as possible, and get to the finish line where
(their idea of) happiness awaits.

### PROMPT
- How is my protagonist going to execute their plan (achieve goal, avoid fear)?
- What is their step-by-step plan for making this happen? (Even if they don’t know
every step themselves).
- How can I show my reader the REASONING behind my protagonist’s actions (aka:
how their every decision is fundamentally based on their misbelief)?

## Game-Changing Midpoint: Plot Twist!

### Explanation
A game-changing midpoint doesn’t have to be some epic and crazy twist of fate.
In fact, the only thing a game-changing midpoint has to do is surprise the
protagonist and shift their goal. (Bonus points if you can surprise the reader
at the same time!) It can be as dramatic as “everything protagonist believes is
actually a lie” OR as simple as “protagonist realizes they are falling in love
with their nemesis.”

### PROMPT
- What unexpected thing is going to upend my protagonist’s plan (and entire
life)?
- Why does it matter to my protagonist, given their desire and fear?
- How is it going to change the game for my protagonist?

## Post-Midpoint Action Hero: Protagonist Approaches Their Goal from a Different Angle

### Explanation
Figure out how your protagonist is going to handle the plot twist. It’s sort of like
another inciting incident, shoving them further outside their comfort zone and
presenting a new and unexpected challenge. Give your protagonist a plan going
forward – and a sense of where this is going. Your readers want to know what
happens next because they can foresee what MIGHT happen.

### Prompt
- What is my protagonist’s NEW plan going to be, based on the game-changing
midpoint and what it means to them?
- How does my protagonist think their new plan is going to actually work and
bring them to their goal while STILL avoiding their fear?

## Second Pinch Point: Opposition/Antagonistic Force Gets Closer

### Explanation
Remember, your “opposition” doesn’t have to be an actual villain or even a
person — it can be the protagonist’s misbelief always looming in the
background, getting ready to attack them come act 3. Whatever the major
“opposition” your protagonist is going to face off with at the climax of your
story, that’s what you want to give the reader a taste of at this story beat.

### Prompt
- How can I show the opposition/antagonistic force now getting closer to
disrupting the protagonist’s life?

# Act 3

## Supposed Victory: Protagonist Thinks They Have overcome

### Explanation
Making progress with their new-and-improved plan, the protagonist feels
confident they will be victorious. Or perhaps they have already overcome the
smallest of the challenges and feel pretty good about their plan. Little do
they know, disaster is on the way. (NOTE: this plot point is optional, but
awesome.)

### PROMPT
- Why does my protagonist think they will be victorious?
- What’s happening to make them feel SO CLOSE to achieving their goal and
finding happiness at last?

## Disaster: Everything Goes Wrong

### Explanation
Bring your protagonist to their knees by rooting the disaster in their greatest
fear and misbelief. It might be something that’s terrible for anyone to
experience, but go beyond that and make it something especially bad for your
protagonist because of their fear and misbelief. Every decision they have made
throughout the story has led them to this moment…which means they are to blame
for their own ruin.

### Prompt
- What does this disaster specifically mean to my protagonist?
- How does it force them to realize that they’re the one to blame for this crisis?
- How does it completely disarm them and make them face off with their fear and
misbelief?

## Dark Moment: Protagonist is Hopeless

### Explanation
It’s always darkest before the dawn. Your protagonist needs a rock-bottom
moment in order to have an “aha” moment — and that’s what makes the revelation
so satisfying. But right now, in wake of the disaster, your protagonist is
feeling utterly and completely broken, confused, lost, and disappointed.

### Prompt
- How is my protagonist forced into the ring with their kryptonite?

## Aha Moment: Renewed Hope

### Explanation
This is the biggest pivotal moment in your whole story. After your protagonist
has been brought to their knees by the disaster, they have a revelation — an
aha moment.  They can suddenly see how their fear and misbelief has led them to
make the wrong decisions about everything. They realize how wrong they were —
but most importantly, they see that they’ll have to overcome their
fear/misbelief and make the RIGHT decision in order to achieve their goal: true
happiness.

### Prompt
- How is my protagonist going to overcome their fear and continue to the
climax, therefore developing as a character?
- What lesson are they going to learn (and simultaneously teach the audience?)

## Temptation and Aha Moment
*Alternative to a disaster + dark moment*

### Explanation
Instead of everything going wrong for your protagonist… everything goes right.
They are given the opportunity to finally have the thing they’ve ALWAYS wanted
(the misbelief-based goal they’ve been chasing this whole time.) But now, they
turn it down.  Because, after going on this transformative journey, they
realize: they don’t want it anymore. They have found something so much better.
They have found true happiness.

### Prompt
- What is it the specific misbelief-based goal that my protagonist has been
chasing this whole time?
- How is my protagonist offered the chance to finally have this thing they’ve
always wanted?
- How will my protagonist prove their transformation by turning down this offer?

## Climactic Confrontation: Protagonist Faces Their Biggest Challenge Yet

### Explanation
This is the moment everyone has been waiting for, where the protagonist is
going to face their most difficult challenge yet. It’s a true test of their
character — and how they respond to the confrontation is the proof that they’ve
TRANSFORMED…as a result of their journey. So your protagonist has already won
the internal battle (in their “aha” moment) but now it’s time for them to win
the external battle (which of course will force them to face off with their
greatest fears.)

### Prompt
- How does my protagonist prove their transformation by crushing their misbelief
and facing their greatest fear with courage?

## Victory: Protagonist Overcomes

### Explanation
This doesn’t necessarily mean the protagonist wins the external battle or that
things turn out exactly how they hoped. But the protagonist does experience a
personal victory—because they overcame their fear and destroyed their
misbelief. Here’s my rule of thumb: if your reader doesn’t know how the
character has transformed as a result of their journey, you need to rewrite
your book until they do.

### PROMPT:
- How has my protagonist changed as a result of their journey?

## Resolution: Wrapping Up Loose Ends

### Explanation
This is the part where all the loose ends are tied up. The reader should be
left with no missing information or silent questions. If the book is part of a
series, then you may want to end on a cliffhanger by swapping out the “victory”
story beat with another “plot twist.” If the book is a standalone, make sure
the reader’s questions are answered when they reach the final page.

### Prompt
- Where will my protagonist go from here?
- What does their life look like, now that they have overcome their misbelief?
