# WritingProjectTemplate

Obsidian vault template inspired by the way author Abbie Emmons' organizes Scrivener as she explained in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-k8N800DbE).

# How I Use This Template
I find it easier for all of my writing projects to live in one repository and just have a separate branch for each project. I keep `main` clean and branch from `main` when I create a new project. YMMV.

# Notes about Vim

Vim is enabled in this vault, because I use it (lack of Vim support is among the reasons I ultimately chose Obsidian over Scrivener in the first place.) If you don't want Vim-like editing, it can be disabled in Settings -> Editor.

Vimrc Support is installed into this workspace and it is configured to read from a file inside the vault's root called `.vimrc`. On my machine, this is a symlink to `~/.vimrc`. You will need to configure this to your environment.

# TODOs
This is an evolving project. Abbie has a fantastic process that I'm trying to capture in this vault, but I'll probably be adding my own flavor over time. For now, these are the things I'm planning on adding to this:
